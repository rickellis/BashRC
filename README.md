Linux and Mac cross-platform .bashrc

Since I often switch between Arch Linux and Mac it makes my life easier to have shared terminal commands and settings. 

Anything that is platform specific goes into either __.bash_linux__ or __.bash_mac__. When those files are loaded an OS check happens and any commands that are not available get ignored.
